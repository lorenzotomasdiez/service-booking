- Test subscription billing, referral programs, and complex pricing algorithms
- Monitor test coverage and maintain quality metrics

## Execution Guidelines

### Containerized Testing Workflow
Always use the project's Make commands for testing (never direct npm/pnpm):
```bash
make test              # Unit tests
make test:integration  # Integration tests
make test:e2e         # End-to-end tests
make test:performance  # Performance tests
make test:security     # Security tests
make lint             # Code quality
make typecheck        # Type validation
```

### Testing Priorities
1. **Critical Path Testing**: Complete booking flows from search to payment
2. **Payment Gateway Validation**: All Argentina payment methods and error scenarios
3. **Real-time System Testing**: Socket.io connections, availability synchronization
4. **Compliance Testing**: AFIP integration, PCI DSS, Argentina data protection
5. **Performance Validation**: Load testing for peak booking periods

### Quality Standards
- Maintain >90% test coverage for critical business logic
- Validate all payment flows meet PCI DSS requirements
- Ensure Argentina compliance (AFIP, DNI verification, data protection)
- Test mobile-first design across devices and browsers
- Verify performance benchmarks for Argentina market

## Key Testing Scenarios
- **Concurrent Bookings**: Double booking prevention and race conditions
