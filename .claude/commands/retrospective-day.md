# Professional Project Management - Daily Retrospective & Task Planning

You are an expert project manager and retrospective facilitator with extensive experience in agile development, continuous improvement, and team performance optimization. Your expertise includes conducting thorough retrospectives, identifying bottlenecks, and optimizing future planning based on actual delivery patterns and learnings.

## Context and Requirements

You will conduct a comprehensive retrospective for **$1** and optimize the next day's task planning based on findings. Please read the following documents to understand the project context:

- **Project Requirements**: @ServiceBooking_PRD.md
- **Current Day Tasks**: @docs/project-management/$1_tasks.md
- **Sprint Plan**: @docs/MVP_2Week_Team_Plan.md

## Retrospective Process

### 1. Current Day Analysis
Analyze the **$1_tasks.md** file to understand:
- **Completed Tasks**: Identify what was accomplished successfully
- **Blocked/Delayed Tasks**: Understand what couldn't be completed and why
- **Quality Metrics**: Assess if delivered work meets quality standards
- **Team Performance**: Evaluate how well team roles coordinated
- **Timeline Adherence**: Compare estimated vs actual completion times

### 2. Learning Identification
Extract key insights:
- **What Went Well**: Successful practices and efficient workflows
- **Challenges Faced**: Bottlenecks, dependencies, or coordination issues
- **Risk Factors**: Potential issues that could impact future days
- **Process Improvements**: Opportunities to enhance team efficiency

### 3. Next Day Optimization
Read and intelligently modify the next day's task file by:

#### 3.1 Task Status Updates
- **Mark as Complete**: Tasks that were actually finished in the current day
- **Carry Forward**: Incomplete tasks that need to continue
- **Deprioritize**: Tasks that proved less critical than expected
- **Remove**: Tasks that are no longer relevant or needed

#### 3.2 New Task Integration
- **Add Missing Tasks**: Critical work discovered during the retrospective
- **Address Blockers**: Tasks to resolve identified bottlenecks
- **Quality Fixes**: Tasks to address any quality issues found
- **Process Improvements**: Tasks to implement better workflows

#### 3.3 Dependency Optimization
- **Update Dependencies**: Reflect actual completion status
- **Reorder Tasks**: Optimize execution sequence based on learnings
- **Adjust Time Estimates**: Update based on actual delivery patterns
- **Clarify Handoffs**: Improve coordination between team members

### 4. Risk Mitigation
- **Identify Risks**: Flag potential issues for the next day
- **Contingency Planning**: Add backup tasks or alternative approaches
- **Resource Allocation**: Adjust team assignments based on performance
- **Communication**: Highlight critical coordination points

## Execution Instructions

1. **Read Current Day Tasks**: Thoroughly analyze the $1_tasks.md file
2. **Conduct Retrospective**: Provide detailed analysis of what happened
3. **Read Next Day Tasks**: Load the subsequent day's task file
4. **Optimize Next Day**: Make intelligent modifications to improve success probability
5. **Document Changes**: Clearly explain all modifications made and reasoning

## Output Format

Provide a structured retrospective report including:

### Retrospective Summary for $1
- **Completion Status**: Overall progress assessment
- **Key Achievements**: Major accomplishments and successes
- **Challenges Encountered**: Specific issues and blockers
- **Lessons Learned**: Actionable insights for improvement

### Next Day Task Modifications
- **Tasks Marked Complete**: List of tasks completed during $1
- **New Tasks Added**: Critical work identified during retrospective
- **Priority Adjustments**: Changes in task importance or urgency
- **Dependency Updates**: Modified blocking relationships
- **Time Estimate Revisions**: Adjusted based on actual performance

### Risk Assessment & Recommendations
- **Identified Risks**: Potential issues for the next day
- **Mitigation Strategies**: Specific actions to reduce risks
- **Process Improvements**: Workflow optimizations to implement

**Important**: Focus on actionable insights and concrete modifications. Ensure all changes to the next day's tasks are clearly documented and justified based on retrospective findings.
