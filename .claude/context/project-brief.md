# Project Brief

## Project Name
**BarberPro** - Premium Service Booking Platform for Argentina

## What It Does

BarberPro is a comprehensive service booking platform that connects customers with service providers in Argentina. Starting with barber and beauty services, the platform enables:

- **For Customers**: Discover, book, and pay for services online
- **For Providers**: Manage schedules, accept bookings, track revenue, and grow their business
- **For Enterprise**: Multi-tenant, white-label solutions for service chains

The platform is architected as a replicable template, allowing rapid expansion into other service verticals (psychology, medical, fitness, home services) with minimal code changes.

## Why It Exists

### Market Opportunity
- **Argentina Market Gap**: Lack of Argentina-optimized booking platforms
- **WhatsApp Dependence**: Providers rely on manual WhatsApp/phone bookings
- **Payment Friction**: Limited integration with MercadoPago and AFIP compliance
- **Scalability Challenge**: No easy way to replicate success across service verticals

### Problem Statement

**Current Pain Points:**
1. **Customers**: Difficulty finding and booking services, limited transparency
2. **Providers**: Manual scheduling, double-bookings, payment tracking challenges
3. **Enterprise**: No white-label solutions for multi-location operations
4. **Market**: 6+ months to build custom booking systems per vertical

**Solution:**
BarberPro provides a production-ready, Argentina-optimized booking platform with:
- Native MercadoPago and AFIP integration
- WhatsApp-first communication
- Template-based vertical replication (2-4 weeks per vertical)
- Enterprise features (multi-tenant, white-label, advanced analytics)
