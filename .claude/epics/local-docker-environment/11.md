# Task: Cross-Platform Testing & Final Polish

## Description

Perform comprehensive cross-platform testing on macOS, Linux, and WSL2 to ensure the Docker environment works consistently across all developer machines. Polish error messages, improve user experience, optimize performance, and validate all success criteria from the PRD.

**Goal**: Production-ready Docker environment that works flawlessly on all supported platforms with excellent developer experience.

## Acceptance Criteria

## Technical Details

**Platform-Specific Test Plan**:

**macOS Testing** (Intel and Apple Silicon):
```bash
# Test script for macOS
./scripts/test-macos.sh

# Contents:
1. Docker Desktop version check
2. Architecture detection (x86_64 vs arm64)
3. All Makefile commands
4. Performance benchmarks
5. Port availability checks
6. Color output verification
```

**Linux Testing** (Ubuntu 22.04):
```bash
# Test script for Linux
./scripts/test-linux.sh

# Contents:
1. Docker version check
2. User permissions (docker group)
3. All Makefile commands
4. Performance benchmarks
5. systemd service checks
6. Color output verification
```

**WSL2 Testing** (Windows):
```bash
# Test script for WSL2
./scripts/test-wsl2.sh

# Contents:
1. WSL version check
2. Docker Desktop WSL2 backend verification
3. All Makefile commands
4. Performance benchmarks
5. Windows/WSL path handling
6. Color output verification
```

**Performance Benchmark Script**:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# scripts/benchmark.sh

echo "⏱️ Running Performance Benchmarks..."

# Cold start (no images)
echo "Testing cold start..."
make clean
START=$(date +%s)
make up
END=$(date +%s)
COLD_START=$((END - START))
echo "Cold start: ${COLD_START}s"

# Warm start (images cached)
echo "Testing warm start..."
make down
START=$(date +%s)
make dev
END=$(date +%s)
WARM_START=$((END - START))
echo "Warm start: ${WARM_START}s"

# Reset time
echo "Testing reset..."
START=$(date +%s)
make reset
END=$(date +%s)
RESET_TIME=$((END - START))
echo "Reset time: ${RESET_TIME}s"

# Memory usage
echo "Testing memory usage..."
MEMORY=$(docker stats --no-stream --format "{{.MemUsage}}" | awk '{sum+=$1} END {print sum}')
echo "Total memory: ${MEMORY}MB"

# Success criteria validation
echo ""
echo "Success Criteria:"
echo "  Cold start < 60s:  $([[ $COLD_START -lt 60 ]] && echo '✓' || echo '✗') (${COLD_START}s)"
echo "  Warm start < 15s:  $([[ $WARM_START -lt 15 ]] && echo '✓' || echo '✗') (${WARM_START}s)"
echo "  Reset < 2min:      $([[ $RESET_TIME -lt 120 ]] && echo '✓' || echo '✗') (${RESET_TIME}s)"
echo "  Memory < 4GB:      $([[ $MEMORY -lt 4096 ]] && echo '✓' || echo '✗') (${MEMORY}MB)"
```

**UX Polish Examples**:

**Startup Banner** (optional):
```makefile
up: check-docker check-ports
	@echo "$(CYAN)"
	@echo "╔═══════════════════════════════════════╗"
	@echo "║       BarberPro Development Env       ║"
	@echo "╚═══════════════════════════════════════╝"
	@echo "$(RESET)"
	@echo "$(CYAN)[→]$(RESET) Starting services..."
	# ... rest of command
```

**Improved Error Message**:
```makefile
check-ports:
	@if lsof -ti:5432 > /dev/null 2>&1; then \
		echo "$(RED)[✗]$(RESET) Port 5432 is already in use"; \
		echo ""; \
		echo "$(YELLOW)Possible solutions:$(RESET)"; \
		echo "  1. Stop PostgreSQL:"; \
		echo "     $(CYAN)lsof -ti:5432 | xargs kill -9$(RESET)"; \
		echo ""; \
		echo "  2. Change port in .env:"; \
		echo "     $(CYAN)POSTGRES_PORT=5433$(RESET)"; \
		echo ""; \
		echo "  3. Use existing PostgreSQL:"; \
		echo "     $(CYAN)make dev-external-db$(RESET)"; \
		echo ""; \
		exit 1; \
	fi
```

**Progress Indicator**:
```makefile
# Simple spinner for long operations
define spinner
	@i=0; \
	while [ $$i -lt $(1) ]; do \
		printf "\r$(CYAN)[→]$(RESET) $(2) "; \
		printf "%c" "-" "\\" "|" "/" | head -c1 | tail -c1; \
		sleep 1; \
		i=$$((i + 1)); \
	done; \
	printf "\r$(GREEN)[✓]$(RESET) $(2) \n"
endef
```

```markdown
## Platform-Specific Notes

### macOS
- **Apple Silicon (M1/M2)**: Some images may need arm64 variants
- **Docker Desktop**: Requires at least 8GB memory allocation in settings
- **File watching**: May need `WATCHPACK_POLLING=true` for hot reload

### Linux
- **User permissions**: Add user to docker group: `sudo usermod -aG docker $USER`
- **Systemd**: Docker service must be running: `systemctl start docker`
- **SELinux**: May need `:z` flag on volume mounts

### Windows (WSL2)
- **Path conversion**: Use WSL paths (`/home/user/...`) not Windows paths (`C:\...`)
- **File permissions**: May need `chmod +x` for scripts
- **Docker Desktop**: Ensure WSL2 backend is enabled
- **Line endings**: Set git config `core.autocrlf=input`
```
