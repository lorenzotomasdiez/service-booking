## Parallelization Efficiency

**Approach**: Hybrid (parallel + sequential)

### Phase 1: Parallel Execution
- Stream A, B, C launched simultaneously
- Wall time: ~3 hours (max of individual streams)
- Individual times: 2.5h, 2.5h, 2.5h

### Phase 2: Sequential Execution
- Stream D launched after Stream A completed
- Wall time: ~2 hours
- Dependency: Required setup guide from Stream A

### Phase 3: Final Review
- Cross-reference validation
- Terminology consistency check
- Wall time: ~1 hour (included in stream completion)

**Total Wall Time**: ~6 hours
**Sequential Time**: ~11 hours
**Time Saved**: ~45% reduction
**Parallelization Factor**: 3.0x
