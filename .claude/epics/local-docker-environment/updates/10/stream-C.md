# Stream C: Troubleshooting & Reference

## Scope
Troubleshooting guide, Makefile reference, FAQ

## Files Created
✅ `docs/docker-troubleshooting.md` - Common issues and solutions (29KB, comprehensive)
✅ `docs/makefile-cheat-sheet.md` - Quick command reference (23KB, 52+ commands)
✅ `docs/docker-faq.md` - Frequently asked questions (19KB, 50+ Q&As)

## Progress
- ✅ Created comprehensive troubleshooting guide covering:
  - Services won't start (port conflicts, Docker not running, permissions)
  - Performance issues (slow startup, high memory, slow queries)
  - Connection issues (database, CORS, host access)
  - Database issues (migrations, seeding, connection pool)
  - Mock service issues (not responding, wrong behavior)
  - Monitoring stack issues (Grafana, Prometheus)
  - Reset strategies (soft, medium, hard, nuclear)
  - Platform-specific issues (macOS, Linux, WSL2)
  - Self-service diagnostics and getting help

- ✅ Created Makefile cheat sheet with:
  - Essential commands (help, up, down, restart, reset, status, logs)
  - Environment variants (dev, full, monitoring, mocks, test)
  - Database operations (migrate, seed, reset, backup, restore, shell)
  - Monitoring & debugging (logs, status, ps, stats, health)
  - Service control (shell access, exec)
  - Mock services (start, stop, logs, reset)
  - Monitoring stack (start, stop, logs, grafana)
  - Development tools (version, doctor)
  - Maintenance (reset, clean, rebuild, prune, update, validate)
  - Integration testing (11 test commands)
  - Quick workflows (first-time setup, daily workflow, debugging, etc.)
  - Command comparison tables

- ✅ Created comprehensive FAQ covering:
  - General questions (what, why, requirements)
  - Setup & installation (time, requirements, platforms)
  - Usage & workflow (restart vs reset, when to run commands)
  - Performance & resources (memory usage, optimization)
  - Troubleshooting (common errors, solutions)
  - Database questions (migrations, backups, access)
  - Mock services (what, when, how to use)
  - Architecture & design (why Makefile, why multiple files)
  - Best practices (backups, cleanup, daily usage)
  - Advanced topics (customization, CI/CD, debugging)
