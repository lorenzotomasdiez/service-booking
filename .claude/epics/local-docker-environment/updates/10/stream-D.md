# Stream D: Training & Onboarding Materials

## Scope
Developer onboarding, training checklists, and learning resources

## Files Created
- ✅ `docs/developer-onboarding-checklist.md` - Complete onboarding checklist

## Dependencies
- ✅ Stream A completed (setup guide referenced)
- ✅ Stream B completed (architecture referenced)
- ✅ Stream C completed (troubleshooting, FAQ, cheat sheet referenced)

## Implementation Summary

Created comprehensive developer onboarding checklist with:

### Structure
1. **Pre-Setup (Day 0)**: Prerequisites installation and team access
2. **Initial Setup (Day 1)**: Repository setup, Docker environment, database
3. **Learning Phase (Week 1)**: Documentation reading, codebase exploration, workflows
4. **Validation Checkpoints**: 5 checkpoints to verify progress
5. **Quick Start Guide**: 5-minute version for experienced developers
6. **Detailed Walkthrough**: 20-minute version for newcomers
7. **Common Pitfalls**: 10 most common mistakes and how to avoid them
8. **Best Practices**: Daily workflows, code quality, troubleshooting
9. **Tips and Tricks**: Shell aliases, VS Code snippets, performance optimization
10. **Getting Help**: Self-service resources, team support, emergency contacts

### Key Features
- **Checkbox format**: Every step is actionable and verifiable
- **Time estimates**: Clear expectations for each phase
- **Progressive learning**: Start simple, add complexity gradually
- **Cross-referenced**: Links to all other documentation
- **Validation-focused**: Regular checkpoints ensure success
- **Welcoming tone**: Encourages questions and learning
- **Real examples**: Actual commands, output, and scenarios

### Content Highlights

**Pre-Setup (Day 0)**:
- Complete prerequisites checklist (Docker, Node.js, Git, IDE)
- Platform-specific installation guides (macOS, Windows/WSL2, Linux)
- Team access verification (GitHub, Slack, project board)
- Validation script to check all prerequisites

**Initial Setup (Day 1)**:
- Step-by-step environment setup (clone, install, configure)
- Docker services startup and health verification
- Database migrations and seeding
- Admin tools exploration (pgAdmin, Redis Commander)
- Development servers startup
- Complete workflow testing

**Learning Phase (Week 1)**:
- Day 1-2: Core documentation reading
- Day 2-3: Codebase exploration (backend, frontend, database)
- Day 3-4: Practice common workflows (daily, debugging, switching branches)
- Day 4-5: Testing and mock services
- Day 5-7: First task implementation and PR

**Validation Checkpoints**:
1. Environment Setup (End of Day 1)
2. Basic Operations (Day 2-3)
3. Troubleshooting (Day 3-5)
4. Documentation Navigation (Day 5)
5. First Contribution (End of Week 1)

**Common Pitfalls** (10 issues):
1. Using localhost instead of service names
2. Forgetting to run migrations
3. Not stopping services before switching branches
4. Deleting data by accident
5. Running out of disk space
6. Port conflicts
7. Docker Desktop not running
8. Expecting instant startup
9. Not reading error messages
10. Editing wrong .env file

**Best Practices**:
- Daily workflow routines
- Code quality checks before committing
- Database management (backup, test environment)
- Systematic troubleshooting approach
- Resource management and optimization
- Progressive learning strategy

**Tips and Tricks**:
- Shell aliases for quick commands
- VS Code snippets for Docker commands
- Keyboard shortcuts
- Browser bookmarks organization
- Git workflow optimization
- Performance optimization (Docker, npm, WSL2)
- Debugging tips (backend, database, VS Code)

### Integration with Other Docs

Successfully references all completed documentation:
- [Docker Setup Guide](./docker-setup-guide.md) - Detailed setup steps
- [Docker Architecture](./docker-architecture.md) - System design
- [Docker Troubleshooting](./docker-troubleshooting.md) - Problem solving
- [Makefile Cheat Sheet](./makefile-cheat-sheet.md) - Command reference
- [Docker FAQ](./docker-faq.md) - Common questions
- [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md) - Project overview

### Documentation Metrics

- **Total content**: ~1,100 lines
- **Sections**: 10 major sections
- **Checkboxes**: 150+ actionable items
- **Code examples**: 100+ command examples
- **Time estimates**: Clear for each phase
- **Cross-references**: 12+ links to other docs

### Quality Assurance

- ✅ Consistent terminology across all documentation
- ✅ Same command patterns as other guides
- ✅ Platform-specific guidance (macOS, Linux, WSL2)
- ✅ Progressive difficulty (simple → complex)
- ✅ Validation at every step
- ✅ Troubleshooting integrated throughout
- ✅ Encouraging, welcoming tone
- ✅ Realistic time estimates
- ✅ Clear success criteria

## Status
✅ **COMPLETED** - Comprehensive onboarding checklist created

This is the final documentation piece that ties everything together. New developers now have a clear, structured path from Day 0 through Week 1, with validation checkpoints and extensive support resources.
