# Stream A: Platform Test Scripts Development

## Scope
Create automated test scripts for all three platforms (macOS, Linux, WSL2) plus performance benchmarking and final validation scripts.

## Files Created
- `scripts/test-macos.sh` - macOS platform test suite (Intel + Apple Silicon)
- `scripts/test-linux.sh` - Linux platform test suite (Ubuntu 22.04+)
- `scripts/test-wsl2.sh` - Windows WSL2 platform test suite
- `scripts/benchmark.sh` - Performance benchmarking suite
- `scripts/final-test.sh` - Final validation checklist

## Implementation Details

### test-macos.sh (18KB)
Comprehensive macOS testing including:
- Platform detection (macOS version, architecture: x86_64 vs arm64)
- Docker Desktop version and resource checks
- Apple Silicon Rosetta 2 detection
- Port availability checks
- All Makefile command testing
- Performance benchmarks
- Color output verification
- macOS-specific checks (fsevents, Homebrew, SIP)

**Key Features:**
- Detects Intel vs Apple Silicon architecture
- Validates Docker Desktop installation and configuration
- Tests minimum 8GB RAM allocation
- Checks Xcode Command Line Tools
- Verifies file watching support (fsevents)

### test-linux.sh (21KB)
Comprehensive Linux testing including:
- Distribution detection (Ubuntu, Debian, etc.)
- Docker Engine version checks
- User permissions (docker group membership)
- systemd service checks
- Port availability checks
- All Makefile command testing
- Performance benchmarks
- Color output verification
- Linux-specific checks (SELinux, AppArmor, inotify limits, storage driver)

**Key Features:**
- Detects Linux distribution and version
- Validates Docker daemon and systemd service
- Checks user is in docker group
- Verifies file watching limits (inotify)
- Tests storage driver (overlay2 recommended)

### test-wsl2.sh (23KB)
Comprehensive WSL2 testing including:
- WSL2 environment detection
- Docker Desktop WSL2 backend verification
- Windows/WSL path handling validation
- Line ending configuration (CRLF vs LF)
- Port availability checks
- All Makefile command testing
- Performance benchmarks
- Color output verification
- WSL2-specific checks (memory limits, file watching, systemd, DNS)

**Key Features:**
- Validates WSL2 kernel and distribution
- Checks Docker Desktop WSL2 integration
- Tests path conversion (wslpath utility)
- Verifies working directory location (WSL vs Windows filesystem)
- Checks line ending configuration (git core.autocrlf)

### benchmark.sh (18KB)
Performance benchmarking suite including:
- Cold start time measurement (full stack from clean state)
- Warm start time measurement (with cached images)
- Environment reset time measurement
- Memory usage analysis per container
- CPU usage sampling
- Validation against success criteria

**Success Criteria:**
- Cold start < 60 seconds
- Warm start < 15 seconds
- Reset < 2 minutes (120 seconds)
- Memory < 4GB (4096MB)

**Key Features:**
- Supports --quick mode to skip cold start
- Detailed memory breakdown per container
- CPU usage monitoring
- Platform-agnostic (detects macOS, Linux, WSL2)
- Comprehensive cleanup after tests

### final-test.sh (21KB)
Final validation checklist including:
- Basic commands (help, version, doctor, validate)
- Lifecycle management (up, status, down)
- Service connectivity (PostgreSQL, Redis, pgAdmin, Redis Commander)
- Database operations (PostgreSQL/Redis connectivity)
- Mock services (start, health checks)
- Integration validation (container health, volumes, network, resources)
- Cleanup operations
- Documentation validation

**Test Categories:**
1. Basic Commands (4 tests)
2. Lifecycle Management (6 tests)
3. Service Connectivity (4 tests)
4. Database Operations (3 tests)
5. Mock Services (2 tests)
6. Integration Validation (4 tests)
7. Cleanup Operations (2 tests)
8. Documentation Validation (variable)

**Key Features:**
- Comprehensive end-to-end validation
- Ready/not-ready status with recommendations
- Success rate calculation
- Production readiness assessment
- Supports --quick mode for faster validation

## Common Features Across All Scripts

### Standard Structure
- Bash shebang: `#!/bin/bash`
- Set flags: `set -euo pipefail` for safe execution
- ANSI color codes for output (Red, Green, Yellow, Blue, Cyan)
- Unicode symbols (✓ ✗ → ⚠ ℹ)
- Verbose and quick modes
- Help documentation

### Test Tracking
- Tests run counter
- Tests passed counter
- Tests failed counter
- Execution time tracking

### Output Format
- Consistent header formatting with boxes
- Test name left-aligned, status right-aligned
- Pass/fail/warn indicators with colors
- Detailed error messages and suggestions
- Final summary report

### Error Handling
- Proper exit codes (0 for success, 1 for failure)
- Helpful error messages with remediation steps
- Platform-specific troubleshooting guidance

## Testing

All scripts have been:
- Created with proper bash syntax
- Made executable with chmod +x
- Structured with consistent formatting
- Documented with comprehensive headers
- Designed for cross-platform compatibility

## Validation Checklist

- [x] test-macos.sh created and executable
- [x] test-linux.sh created and executable
- [x] test-wsl2.sh created and executable
- [x] benchmark.sh created and executable
- [x] final-test.sh created and executable
- [x] All scripts use consistent color scheme
- [x] All scripts have help documentation
- [x] All scripts include verbose mode
- [x] All scripts include quick mode
- [x] All scripts have proper error handling
- [x] All scripts provide actionable error messages
- [x] Scripts are platform-specific where appropriate
- [x] Performance benchmarks validate success criteria
- [x] Final test provides production readiness assessment

## Success Metrics

**Script Completeness:**
