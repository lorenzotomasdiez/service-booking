# Stream C: Platform-Specific Documentation

## Scope
Document platform-specific quirks, performance baseline structures, and troubleshooting guides for macOS, Linux, and WSL2.

## Files Created
- `docker/PLATFORM-NOTES.md` - Platform-specific configuration and quirks for macOS, Linux, and WSL2
- `docker/PERFORMANCE.md` - Performance baseline structure with benchmarking scripts
- `docker/TROUBLESHOOTING.md` - Comprehensive troubleshooting guide for common issues

## Completion Summary

### PLATFORM-NOTES.md
Comprehensive platform-specific documentation covering:
- **macOS**: Intel and Apple Silicon configurations, Docker Desktop setup, common issues
- **Linux**: User permissions, systemd integration, SELinux handling, optimal performance
- **Windows WSL2**: Critical setup requirements, path handling, line endings, file permissions
- **Platform comparison**: Performance metrics, feature comparison, recommendations
- **Architecture notes**: Multi-architecture support, testing across platforms

Key highlights:
- Detailed setup instructions for each platform
- Critical WSL2 filesystem location requirements (avoid /mnt/c)
- Platform-specific troubleshooting sections
- Resource configuration recommendations
- Performance expectations by platform

### PERFORMANCE.md
Performance baseline structure with:
- **Success criteria**: Target metrics for cold start, warm start, reset, memory, and CPU
- **Benchmark commands**: Manual and automated performance testing scripts
- **Platform baselines**: Structure ready for Issue #11 Stream D testing to populate
- **Optimization tips**: Platform-specific performance improvements
- **Troubleshooting**: Solutions for common performance issues
- **Continuous monitoring**: Daily, weekly, and monthly maintenance routines

Key highlights:
- Complete benchmark script template ready to use
- Clear success criteria (cold start <60s, warm start <15s, memory <4GB)
- Platform-specific optimization sections
- Performance regression troubleshooting
- History tracking structure

### TROUBLESHOOTING.md
Comprehensive troubleshooting guide covering:
- **Quick diagnostics**: Commands to run first
- **Common issues**: 9 major issue categories with step-by-step solutions
  - Services won't start
  - Port conflicts
  - Database/Redis connection failures
  - Hot reload issues
  - Docker out of space
  - Performance problems
  - Health check failures
  - Mock service issues
- **Platform-specific**: Dedicated sections for macOS, Linux, and WSL2
- **Advanced troubleshooting**: Docker daemon logs, network debugging, volume inspection
- **Getting help**: Checklist and information to include when asking for support

Key highlights:
- Clear symptom → cause → solution structure
- Copy-paste ready commands
- Platform-specific issue sections
- Troubleshooting checklist
- Advanced debugging techniques

## Cross-References
All three documents cross-reference each other for complete coverage:
- PLATFORM-NOTES.md references TROUBLESHOOTING.md and PERFORMANCE.md
- PERFORMANCE.md references PLATFORM-NOTES.md for platform details
- TROUBLESHOOTING.md references PLATFORM-NOTES.md for platform quirks and PERFORMANCE.md for optimization

## Testing Notes
- Documents are ready for validation during Issue #11 Stream D testing
- Performance baselines to be populated after actual platform testing
- Troubleshooting solutions verified against common developer issues

## Next Steps
- Stream D will perform actual platform testing and populate performance baselines
- Consider adding screenshots/diagrams in future enhancement
- May need to update based on team feedback during rollout
