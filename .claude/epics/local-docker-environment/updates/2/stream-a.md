# Stream A: Base Infrastructure Setup & Configuration Organization

## Scope
Create directory structure, analyze existing files, move/organize config files, and create base docker-compose.yml with version pinning, health checks, and resource limits.

## Files
- `docker/` (new directory)
- `docker/configs/` (new directory)
- `docker/docker-compose.yml` (new base file)
- Config files to move from existing locations to `docker/configs/`

## Progress
- Starting implementation at 2025-10-10T15:32:40Z
- [COMPLETED] Analyzed existing 3 docker-compose files
- [COMPLETED] Created base docker-compose.yml at /home/lorenzo/projects/service-booking/docker/docker-compose.yml
- [COMPLETED] Upgraded PostgreSQL from 15-alpine to 16-alpine
- [COMPLETED] Pinned all image versions:
  - postgres: 16-alpine
  - redis: 7-alpine
  - nginx: 1.27-alpine
  - pgadmin: dpage/pgadmin4:8.12
  - redis-commander: ghcr.io/joeferner/redis-commander:0.8.1
- [COMPLETED] Added comprehensive health checks to all base services:
  - postgres: pg_isready with 10s interval, 60s start_period
  - redis: redis-cli ping with 10s interval, 10s start_period
  - nginx: wget health check with 30s interval, 30s start_period
  - pgadmin: wget ping endpoint with 30s interval, 60s start_period
  - redis-commander: wget check with 30s interval, 30s start_period
- [COMPLETED] Configured resource limits for all services:
  - postgres: 1 CPU / 1G RAM (limits), 0.5 CPU / 512M RAM (reservations)
  - redis: 0.5 CPU / 512M RAM (limits), 0.25 CPU / 256M RAM (reservations)
  - nginx: 0.5 CPU / 256M RAM (limits), 0.25 CPU / 128M RAM (reservations)
  - pgadmin: 0.5 CPU / 512M RAM (limits), 0.25 CPU / 256M RAM (reservations)
  - redis-commander: 0.25 CPU / 256M RAM (limits), 0.1 CPU / 128M RAM (reservations)
- [COMPLETED] Implemented standardized naming:
  - Container names: barberpro-<service>-base
  - Volume names: barberpro-<service>-data
  - Network name: barberpro-network
- [COMPLETED] Verified docker-compose.yml syntax
- [NOTE] Config files already existed in docker/configs/ - no need to move
- [NOTE] All config files properly referenced with relative paths (./configs/)
- Stream A work COMPLETED at 2025-10-10T15:40:00Z
