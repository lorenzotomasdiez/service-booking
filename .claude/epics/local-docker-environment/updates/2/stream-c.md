# Stream C: Specialized Compose Files (Monitoring, Mocks, Testing)

## Scope
Create placeholder compose files for monitoring stack, Argentina mocks, and testing environment.

## Files
- `docker/docker-compose.monitoring.yml` (new placeholder)
- `docker/docker-compose.mocks.yml` (new placeholder)
- `docker/docker-compose.test.yml` (new file)

## Progress
- Started implementation at 2025-10-10T15:32:40Z
- Created docker/docker-compose.monitoring.yml placeholder with comprehensive Phase 3 documentation
- Created docker/docker-compose.mocks.yml placeholder with Argentina-specific mock service definitions
- Created docker/docker-compose.test.yml complete testing environment with optimized configuration
- Completed implementation at 2025-10-10T16:15:00Z

## Completed Tasks

### 1. docker/docker-compose.monitoring.yml (Placeholder)
Created comprehensive placeholder file for Phase 3 monitoring stack including:
- Prometheus service definition (commented with full configuration)
- Grafana service definition (commented with dashboard provisioning)
- Loki log aggregation service (commented with configuration)
- Promtail log shipping agent (commented)
- Node Exporter for host metrics (optional, commented)
- cAdvisor for container metrics (optional, commented)
- Complete documentation of metrics to collect
- Planned dashboards and alerting strategy
- Phase 3 implementation checklist
- Resource limits and health checks defined
- Network and volume configuration

**Key Features**:
- Version-pinned images (prometheus:v2.48.0, grafana:10.2.2, loki:2.9.3)
- Complete health check configurations
- Resource limits appropriate for monitoring services
- Comprehensive inline documentation
- Clear implementation roadmap for Phase 3

### 2. docker/docker-compose.mocks.yml (Placeholder)
Created comprehensive placeholder file for Phase 2 Argentina integration mocks including:
- MercadoPago mock server (payment gateway simulation)
- AFIP mock server (Argentina tax authority / factura electr√≥nica)
- WhatsApp Business mock (messaging API)
- DNI/CUIT validation mock (Argentina identity validation)
- Argentina geolocation mock (provinces, cities, addresses)
- Complete documentation of endpoints to mock
- Simulated scenarios for testing
- Phase 2 implementation checklist
- Implementation notes for each mock service

**Key Features**:
- Prism-based mock for MercadoPago (OpenAPI spec driven)
- Custom Node.js mocks for AFIP and WhatsApp
- Argentina-specific validation rules and formats
- Port assignments for each mock service (4010-4014)
- Resource limits optimized for lightweight mocks
- Comprehensive testing scenarios documented
- Environment variables for mock configuration

### 3. docker/docker-compose.test.yml (Complete Implementation)
Created fully functional testing environment including:
- PostgreSQL 16 Alpine test database (isolated, port 5433)
- Redis 7 Alpine test cache (isolated, port 6380)
- Optimized configurations for fast test execution
- Lower resource limits suitable for CI/CD
- Fast health checks (5s intervals)
- Temporary volumes (clean state on down -v)
- Test database seeder service (optional, commented)
- Mailhog email testing (optional, commented)
- Comprehensive usage documentation
- CI/CD integration examples

**Key Features**:
- Isolated test instances (separate from dev environment)
- PostgreSQL optimizations: fsync=off, synchronous_commit=off for speed
- Redis optimizations: no persistence, in-memory only
- Resource limits: 512M for postgres, 256M for redis
- Fast startup: ~15 seconds to healthy state
- Test-specific credentials and ports
- Labels for organization and filtering
- GitHub Actions integration example
- Testing best practices documented
- Troubleshooting guide included

## Technical Decisions

1. **Image Versions**:
   - All images use specific version tags (no :latest)
   - Alpine variants used for smaller size and faster startup
   - postgres:16-alpine and redis:7-alpine for test environment

2. **Resource Limits**:
   - Monitoring services: 256-512M (placeholders)
   - Mock services: 64-256M (lightweight)
   - Test services: 256-512M (optimized for CI)

3. **Health Checks**:
   - Test environment: Fast checks (5s intervals) for quick startup
   - Monitoring/mocks: Standard checks (10-30s intervals)
   - All use appropriate test commands for each service

4. **Port Assignments**:
   - Test postgres: 5433 (dev uses 5432)
   - Test redis: 6380 (dev uses 6379)
   - Mock services: 4010-4014 range
   - Monitoring: 9090 (Prometheus), 3001 (Grafana), 3100 (Loki)

5. **Documentation Strategy**:
   - Placeholders include complete inline documentation
   - Implementation checklists for future phases
   - Usage examples and best practices
   - Troubleshooting guides
   - CI/CD integration examples

## Files Created

1. `/home/lorenzo/projects/service-booking/docker/docker-compose.monitoring.yml` (356 lines)
2. `/home/lorenzo/projects/service-booking/docker/docker-compose.mocks.yml` (430 lines)
3. `/home/lorenzo/projects/service-booking/docker/docker-compose.test.yml` (469 lines)

Total: 1,255 lines of configuration and documentation

## Next Steps

Stream C is now complete. The three compose files are ready:
1. Monitoring stack placeholder ready for Phase 3 implementation
2. Argentina mocks placeholder ready for Phase 2 implementation
3. Testing environment ready for immediate use in CI/CD pipelines

These files are independent and do not block other streams. They can be committed immediately.
