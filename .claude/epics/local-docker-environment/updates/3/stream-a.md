# Stream A: Foundation & Infrastructure

## Scope
Core Makefile structure, color definitions, OS detection, environment loading, help system

## Files
- `Makefile` (created - foundation section)
- `.PHONY` declarations

## Progress
- [x] Created Makefile with foundation structure
- [x] Implemented color definitions using tput (cross-platform)
- [x] Added OS detection (Darwin/Linux)
- [x] Implemented .env loading mechanism
- [x] Set default goal to help
- [x] Created comprehensive help command with awk formatting
- [x] Added all .PHONY declarations for 30+ commands
- [x] Created section markers for Streams B, C, D
- [x] Implemented version command
- [x] Implemented doctor command (system diagnostics)
- [x] Added internal prerequisite checks (check-docker, check-ports)
- [x] Added placeholder commands for all streams
- [x] Tested all foundation commands

## Implementation Details

### Color System
- Uses `tput -Txterm setaf N` for cross-platform compatibility
- Fallback to empty string if tput not available (graceful degradation)
- Colors: GREEN, YELLOW, RED, BLUE, CYAN, RESET
- Unicode symbols: CHECK (✓), CROSS (✗), WARN (⚠), INFO (ℹ), ARROW (→)

### OS Detection
- Detects macOS (Darwin) and Linux
- Sets appropriate OPEN command for each OS

### Docker Compose Configuration
- Defined compose file combinations for different environments
- COMPOSE_BASE, COMPOSE_DEV, COMPOSE_MONITORING, COMPOSE_MOCKS, COMPOSE_TEST, COMPOSE_FULL

### Help System
- Beautiful formatted help output with box drawing characters
- Section-based organization
- Shows which stream implements which commands
- Lists common commands prominently

### Prerequisite Checks
- check-docker: Verifies Docker is running
- check-ports: Verifies ports 5432 and 6379 are available
- Provides helpful error messages with solutions

### Commands Implemented (Foundation)
1. help - Comprehensive help display
2. version - Shows versions of Docker, docker-compose, Node.js, npm
3. doctor - Complete system diagnostics with:
   - Prerequisites check (Docker, docker-compose, Node, npm, make)
   - Configuration files check
   - Port availability check
   - Helpful color-coded status indicators

### Section Markers
Created clear section markers for:
- Stream B: Lifecycle Management & Environment Variants
- Stream C: Database Operations & Development Tools
- Stream D: Monitoring & Debugging & Maintenance

Each section includes placeholder commands that show warning messages indicating the stream responsible for implementation.

## Testing Results
- `make help` - Works perfectly with colored output
- `make version` - Successfully shows all version information
- `make doctor` - Complete diagnostics with color-coded results
- All placeholder commands show appropriate warning messages
- Cross-platform color support working (tested on Linux/WSL2)

## Notes for Other Streams
- All color variables and OS detection are ready to use
- All .PHONY declarations are in place
- Docker Compose command variables are defined
- Internal check commands (check-docker, check-ports) are available
- Section markers clearly indicate where each stream should add code

## Blockers
None

## Ready for Next Streams
Stream A is complete. Streams B, C, and D can now begin their work in parallel.
