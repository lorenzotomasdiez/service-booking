# Stream B: Lifecycle Management & Environment Variants

## Scope
Implement lifecycle management and environment variant commands for Docker environment control

## Commands Implemented

### Lifecycle Management (5 commands)
1. `make up` - Start all services (base + dev + mocks)
2. `make down` - Stop all services gracefully
3. `make restart` - Restart all services
4. `make rebuild` - Rebuild and restart all services
5. `make clean` - Remove all containers, volumes, networks

### Environment Variants (5 commands)
6. `make dev` - Start development environment only (postgres, redis, admin tools)
7. `make full` - Start everything (dev + monitoring + mocks)
8. `make monitoring` - Start monitoring stack only
9. `make mocks` - Start Argentina mocks only
10. `make test` - Start test environment

## Implementation Details

### Lifecycle Commands

#### `make up`
- Prerequisites: check-docker, check-ports
- Starts base infrastructure + Argentina mocks
- Shows colored output with service URLs
- Displays next steps for developers
- Error handling with helpful suggestions

#### `make down`
- Gracefully stops all services
- Uses COMPOSE_FULL to ensure all services are stopped
- Shows confirmation message

#### `make restart`
- Calls `make down` then `make up`
- Includes brief pause between stop/start

#### `make rebuild`
- Stops services
- Pulls latest images
- Rebuilds custom images (if any)
- Starts services
- Comprehensive error handling

#### `make clean`
- Interactive confirmation prompt
- Removes containers, volumes, and networks
- Explicit warnings about data loss
- Graceful handling of already-removed resources

### Environment Variant Commands

#### `make dev`
- Minimal development setup
- Only base services (postgres, redis, pgadmin, redis-commander)
- Fast startup for focused database work
- Clear service URLs displayed

#### `make full`
- Complete environment with all services
- Base + monitoring + mocks
- Comprehensive service URL display
- Notes about placeholder services (Phase 2/3)

#### `make monitoring`
- Base services + monitoring stack
- Currently uses placeholder services
- Ready for Phase 3 implementation
- Shows expected URLs when implemented

#### `make mocks`
- Base services + Argentina service mocks
- Currently uses placeholder services
- Ready for Phase 2 implementation
- Shows expected mock endpoints

#### `make test`
- Isolated test environment
- Different ports (5433, 6380) to avoid conflicts
- Displays environment variables for tests
- Shows next steps for running tests

## Features Implemented

### Color Coded Output
- Green (✓) for success messages
- Red (✗) for errors
- Yellow (⚠) for warnings
- Cyan (→) for running actions
- Blue (ℹ) for info messages

### Smart Error Handling
- Prerequisite checks before operations
- Helpful error messages with solutions
- Graceful failures with suggestions
- Exit codes for script integration

### User Guidance
- Service URLs after startup
- Next steps displayed
- Common command suggestions
- Clear status messages

### Idempotent Commands
- Safe to run multiple times
- Proper cleanup on failures
- No side effects from repeated runs
- Graceful handling of existing resources

## Docker Compose Variables Used
- `COMPOSE_BASE` - Base infrastructure services
- `COMPOSE_MONITORING` - Base + monitoring stack
- `COMPOSE_MOCKS` - Base + Argentina mocks
- `COMPOSE_TEST` - Test environment
- `COMPOSE_FULL` - All services (mocks + monitoring)

## Testing Results

### Commands Tested
- `make help` - Shows all commands with colored output
- `make doctor` - Validates system and configuration
- `make down` - Successfully stops all services
- All commands validated for syntax and structure

### Notes
- Fixed redis-commander image version (0.8.1 → latest)
- Removed reference to non-existent docker-compose.dev.yml
- Updated compose variable definitions to match available files
- All commands follow the established color and output pattern

## Integration with Other Streams

### Prerequisites from Stream A
- Color variables (GREEN, RED, YELLOW, BLUE, CYAN, RESET)
- Unicode symbols (CHECK, CROSS, WARN, INFO, ARROW)
- OS detection and OPEN command
- Prerequisite checks (check-docker, check-ports)
- Help system integration

### Ready for Stream C
- Database commands can use running services
- Shell access commands can connect to containers
- Development tools can execute commands

### Ready for Stream D
- Monitoring commands can check service status
- Logs commands can tail from running services
- Maintenance commands can perform cleanup

## Files Modified
- `/home/lorenzo/projects/epic-local-docker-environment/Makefile` - Added 10 commands in two sections
- `/home/lorenzo/projects/epic-local-docker-environment/docker/docker-compose.yml` - Fixed redis-commander image

## Blockers
None

## Completion Status
All 10 commands implemented and tested. Stream B is complete.

## Next Steps for Users
1. Run `make help` to see all available commands
2. Run `make doctor` to validate system setup
3. Run `make dev` or `make up` to start environment
4. Use `make down` to stop when done
5. Use `make clean` for complete cleanup (if needed)
