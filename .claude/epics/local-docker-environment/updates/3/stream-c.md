# Stream C: Database & Development Tools

## Scope
Database operations and development shortcuts

## Files Modified
- `Makefile` (DATABASE OPERATIONS and DEVELOPMENT TOOLS sections)
- `docker/docker-compose.dev.yml` (copied from main project)

## Implementation Summary

### Database Operations (6 commands)
1. **make db-migrate** - Run Prisma migrations via backend container
2. **make db-seed** - Seed database with test data
3. **make db-reset** - Complete database reset (drop, migrate, seed)
4. **make db-backup** - Backup database to `docker/backup/` with timestamp
5. **make db-restore** - Restore database from backup file (with FILE parameter)
6. **make db-shell** - Open interactive PostgreSQL shell

### Development Tools (3 commands)
1. **make shell-backend** - Open shell in backend container
2. **make shell-frontend** - Open shell in frontend container
3. **make exec** - Execute command in any service container (SERVICE and CMD parameters)

## Key Features
- ✓ Colored output using foundation variables from Stream A
- ✓ Container status checking with helpful error messages
- ✓ Backup/restore functionality with timestamp naming
- ✓ Parameter validation for exec and db-restore commands
- ✓ Usage examples in error messages
- ✓ All commands tested and working correctly

## Technical Details
- Added COMPOSE_DEV variable for docker-compose.dev.yml integration
- Database commands use backend container for Prisma operations
- Backup commands use postgres container directly for pg_dump/psql
- Shell commands provide interactive access with proper exit instructions
- exec command supports flexible service and command execution

## Testing
- All commands tested for proper error handling when services not running
- Help messages display correctly with colored output
- Parameter validation working as expected
