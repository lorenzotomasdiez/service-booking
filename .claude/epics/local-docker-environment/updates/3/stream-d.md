# Stream D: Monitoring & Maintenance

## Scope
Monitoring/debugging commands and maintenance operations

## Files
- `Makefile` (MONITORING & DEBUGGING and MAINTENANCE sections)

## Progress
- [x] Implemented all monitoring commands (6 commands)
- [x] Implemented all maintenance commands (4 commands)
- [x] Tested all commands successfully
- [x] Updated progress file

## Implementation Details

### Monitoring & Debugging Commands (6)
1. `make logs` - Tails logs from all services with timestamps
2. `make status` - Shows service health status in table format
3. `make ps` - Lists running BarberPro containers with count
4. `make stats` - Shows real-time resource usage (CPU, memory)
5. `make health` - Runs detailed health checks on all services
6. `make logs-backend` / `make logs-frontend` - Service-specific logs

### Maintenance Commands (4)
1. `make reset` - Complete environment reset (down + clean + up + seed ready)
   - Interactive confirmation required
   - 4-step process with status messages
   - Calls Stream B's `down` and `up` commands
2. `make prune` - Removes unused Docker resources
   - Interactive confirmation
   - Cleans containers, networks, images, and build cache
3. `make update` - Pulls latest images and rebuilds
   - No confirmation needed (non-destructive)
4. `make validate` - Validates all docker-compose files
   - Checks syntax and file existence
   - Shows validation status for each file

## Testing Results
All commands tested successfully:
- `make status` - Works with colored table output
- `make ps` - Lists containers with count
- `make validate` - Successfully validated all 4 compose files
- Color output working correctly on Linux/WSL2

## Notes
- All commands use colored output with Stream A's foundation
- Error messages are helpful and include next steps
- Commands are idempotent and safe to run multiple times
- Interactive confirmations for destructive operations
- Proper coordination with Stream B commands (reset calls down/up)
