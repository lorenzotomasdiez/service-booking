# Stream A: Core Server & Payment API

## Scope
Set up Express.js server structure, payment endpoints, and core payment logic

## Files
- `docker/mocks/mercadopago/package.json`
- `docker/mocks/mercadopago/index.js`
- `docker/mocks/mercadopago/routes/payments.js`
- `docker/mocks/mercadopago/services/payment.service.js`
- `docker/mocks/mercadopago/config/scenarios.json`

## Progress

### Completed Tasks
- [x] Created directory structure for MercadoPago mock server
- [x] Initialized Node.js project with Express.js dependencies
- [x] Implemented Express.js server entry point with:
  - Health check endpoint
  - Swagger documentation integration
  - Request logging middleware
  - Error handling
  - Graceful shutdown handling
- [x] Created payment routes with:
  - POST /v1/payments - Create payment
  - GET /v1/payments/:id - Get payment by ID
  - PUT /v1/payments/:id - Update payment status
  - GET /v1/payments - List all payments
  - DELETE /v1/payments - Clear all payments (testing)
- [x] Implemented payment service with:
  - In-memory payment storage
  - Payment validation (amount, method, payer)
  - Argentina-specific payment methods support
  - Installment calculation
  - Payment status management
  - Refund functionality (integrated with Stream B)
  - Statistics tracking

  - Timeout simulation
  - Network error simulation
  - Payment methods catalog (cards, tickets, account money)
- [x] Set up Winston logging for structured JSON logging
- [x] Committed basic structure for other streams to integrate
- [x] Tested server functionality:
  - Server starts successfully on port 3001
  - All endpoints functional
  - Tests passing (35/37, 95% coverage on payment service)
  - Dependencies installed (Express, Winston, UUID, Axios)
