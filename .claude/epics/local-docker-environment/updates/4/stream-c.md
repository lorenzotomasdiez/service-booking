# Stream C: Webhook Simulation

## Scope
Build webhook delivery system with configurable delays

## Files Created/Modified
- `docker/mocks/mercadopago/routes/webhooks.js` - ✅ CREATED
- `docker/mocks/mercadopago/services/webhook.service.js` - ✅ ENHANCED
- `docker/mocks/mercadopago/index.js` - ✅ UPDATED (registered webhook routes)
- `docker/mocks/mercadopago/routes/payments.js` - ✅ UPDATED (integrated webhook triggers)
- `docker/mocks/mercadopago/tests/webhook.test.js` - ✅ UPDATED (added new tests)

## Implementation Summary

### 1. Enhanced webhook.service.js
- Converted to class-based singleton pattern
- Added configurable webhook URL (via constructor and setWebhookUrl method)
- Implemented retry logic with exponential backoff (3 attempts, 2s/4s/6s delays)
- Added `triggerWebhook()` method with configurable delay support
- Added `buildWebhookPayload()` for consistent webhook format
- Enhanced signature generation using HMAC-SHA256
- Added `getConfig()` and `setWebhookUrl()` for configuration management
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing methods

### 2. Created routes/webhooks.js
- `POST /api/webhooks/trigger/:paymentId` - Manual webhook trigger with optional delay
- `GET /api/webhooks/config` - Get current webhook configuration
- `PUT /api/webhooks/config` - Update webhook URL
- `POST /api/webhooks/test` - Test webhook delivery without payment
- Full Swagger documentation for all endpoints
- URL validation for config updates

### 3. Updated index.js
- Registered webhook routes
- Added webhooksRouter import and middleware

### 4. Updated payments.js
- Integrated webhook triggering with scenario delays
- Automatic webhook delivery on payment creation
- Webhook delivery on refund with 500ms delay
- Support for custom webhook URLs via notification_url

### 5. Enhanced Tests
- Added 8 new test cases for webhook functionality
- Tests for webhook routes (config, trigger, test)
- Tests for webhook service methods (buildPayload, getConfig, setWebhookUrl)
- Tests for delayed webhook triggering
- All tests passing (21/21 pass)

## Key Features Implemented

### Webhook Service Features
- Configurable webhook URL (environment variable or runtime configuration)
- Retry logic with exponential backoff (3 attempts: 2s, 4s, 6s)
- Configurable delays for webhook delivery
- HMAC-SHA256 signature generation
- Support for payment.created and payment.updated actions
- Proper error handling and logging
- Queue support for future enhancements

### Webhook Routes Features
- Manual webhook triggering via API
- Webhook configuration management
- Test webhook endpoint
- Immediate or delayed webhook delivery
- Custom webhook URL support per request
- Full API documentation

### Integration Features
- Automatic webhook triggers on payment creation
- Webhook triggers on refund operations
- Scenario-based delay configuration
- Custom notification_url support
- Backward compatibility with existing code

## Environment Variables
```
MERCADOPAGO_MOCK_WEBHOOK_URL=http://localhost:3000/api/webhooks/mercadopago
WEBHOOK_SECRET=mock_secret_for_signature
```

## API Endpoints Added
- POST /api/webhooks/trigger/:paymentId - Trigger webhook manually
- GET /api/webhooks/config - Get webhook configuration
- PUT /api/webhooks/config - Update webhook URL
- POST /api/webhooks/test - Test webhook delivery

## Test Coverage
- 21 tests total, all passing
- Webhook service unit tests
- Webhook routes integration tests
- Payment flow integration tests
- Retry logic tests (manual verification needed for full retry flow)

## Success Criteria Verification
- ✅ Webhook service created with trigger mechanism
- ✅ Configurable delays working
- ✅ Webhook payload follows MercadoPago format
- ✅ Retry logic implemented (3 attempts with exponential backoff)
- ✅ Manual trigger endpoint functional
- ✅ Integration with payment events (automatic triggers)
- ✅ Swagger documentation complete
- ✅ Routes registered in index.js
- ✅ Works with Stream D's dashboard (webhook trigger endpoint at /api/dashboard/webhook/:paymentId)

## Notes
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing webhook methods
- Dashboard route already has webhook trigger at /api/dashboard/webhook/:paymentId which uses the enhanced service
- Webhook delivery is asynchronous to avoid blocking payment creation
- Retry logic uses exponential backoff (2s, 4s, 6s)
- Signature generation uses HMAC-SHA256 for security
- All endpoints fully documented with Swagger

## Dependencies
- Stream A: ✅ COMPLETED - Payment storage interface integrated
- Stream D: ✅ COMPATIBLE - Dashboard webhook trigger works with enhanced service
- Stream E: ✅ TESTABLE - All tests passing

## Progress
- ✅ COMPLETED - All acceptance criteria met
