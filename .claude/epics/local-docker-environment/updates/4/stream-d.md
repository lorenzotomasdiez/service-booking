- `docker/mocks/mercadopago/public/dashboard.js` - Client-side functionality
- `docker/mocks/mercadopago/routes/dashboard.js` - Dashboard API endpoints

## Progress

### Completed ✓

   - Scenario control section with dropdown and switcher
   - Transaction history table with real-time display
   - Manual webhook trigger interface
   - Clear history functionality with confirmation modal
   - Link to API documentation
   - Argentina-localized (Spanish UI)

2. **Dashboard Styling** (`styles.css`)
   - Professional design with Argentina color scheme
   - MercadoPago brand colors (blue/green)
   - Responsive design for mobile and desktop
   - Status badges for payment states (approved, pending, rejected)
   - Smooth animations and transitions

   - Transaction history loading and auto-refresh (10s interval)
   - Manual webhook trigger by payment ID
   - Clear history with confirmation modal
   - Argentina currency formatting (ARS)
   - Error handling and user feedback

4. **Dashboard API Routes** (`routes/dashboard.js`)
   - `GET /api/dashboard/scenario` - Get current active scenario
   - `PUT /api/dashboard/scenario` - Change scenario
   - `GET /api/dashboard/transactions` - Get transaction history (max 100)
   - `DELETE /api/dashboard/transactions` - Clear all transactions
   - `POST /api/dashboard/webhook/:paymentId` - Trigger webhook manually
   - Full Swagger documentation annotations
   - Integration with payment and webhook services

5. **Swagger/OpenAPI Documentation**
   - Already configured in `index.js` by Stream A
   - Added comprehensive Swagger annotations to dashboard routes
   - Accessible at `/docs` endpoint
   - Documents all endpoints from Streams A, B, C, D

6. **Integration with Existing Services**
   - Dashboard routes registered in `index.js`
   - Integrated with `paymentService` for transaction data
   - Integrated with `webhookService` for manual triggers
   - Uses shared `scenarios.json` configuration
   - Proper error handling and logging

## Dashboard Features

### Scenario Switcher
- Displays current active scenario
- Dropdown with all available scenarios from `scenarios.json`
- One-click scenario switching
- Visual feedback on change

### Transaction History
- Table view with columns: ID, Amount (ARS), Status, Method, Time
- Status badges with color coding
- Automatic refresh every 10 seconds
- Displays up to 50 most recent transactions
- Argentina date/time formatting

### Manual Webhook Trigger
- Input field for payment ID
- Sends webhook notification for specific payment
- Shows success/error messages
- Integrates with webhook service

### Clear History
- Button to delete all transaction history
- Confirmation modal before deletion
- Shows count of deleted transactions

## Technical Implementation

### API Endpoints
All endpoints follow RESTful conventions:
- `GET /api/dashboard/scenario` - Read current scenario
- `PUT /api/dashboard/scenario` - Update scenario
- `GET /api/dashboard/transactions` - Read transaction list
- `DELETE /api/dashboard/transactions` - Delete all transactions
- `POST /api/dashboard/webhook/:paymentId` - Trigger webhook

### Data Flow
1. Client JavaScript fetches data from dashboard API
2. Dashboard API reads from payment service
3. Payment service manages in-memory payment storage
4. Webhook service sends notifications when triggered

### Argentina Localization
- Spanish language UI
- ARS currency formatting
- Argentina timezone handling
- MercadoPago brand styling
