# Stream A: Core Infrastructure & Database

## Scope
- Project setup (package.json, dependencies)
- SQLite database setup (schema, connection)
- Directory structure creation
- Configuration system (rules.json, env vars)
- Express.js server bootstrap

## Files Created
- `docker/mocks/afip/package.json` - Node.js project with all required dependencies
- `docker/mocks/afip/index.js` - Express server entry point with health check
- `docker/mocks/afip/database/db.js` - SQLite connection module with async operations
- `docker/mocks/afip/database/schema.sql` - Database schema (invoices, pos_config tables)
- `docker/mocks/afip/config/rules.json` - Tax categories, invoice types, validation rules
- `docker/mocks/afip/.env.example` - Environment variable template
- `docker/mocks/afip/.gitignore` - Git ignore configuration
- `docker/mocks/afip/utils/logger.js` - Winston structured JSON logger
- `docker/mocks/afip/utils/config.js` - Configuration loader utility

## Completed Tasks
✅ Directory structure created (database/, config/, routes/, services/, tests/, utils/)
✅ package.json with dependencies (express, sqlite3, body-parser, winston, swagger-ui-express, cors)
✅ SQLite database schema with invoices and pos_config tables, indexes
✅ Database connection module with singleton pattern and async initialization
✅ Configuration system loading rules.json for tax categories and invoice types
✅ Winston logger with structured JSON logging and console output
✅ Express server with middleware (body-parser, CORS, request logging)
✅ Health check endpoint at /health returning server status
✅ Configuration endpoint at /config for debugging
✅ Graceful shutdown handling (SIGTERM, SIGINT)
✅ Environment variable support via dotenv
✅ Server successfully starts on port 3002
✅ Database initializes and creates schema automatically
✅ All endpoints tested and working

## Test Results
- Server starts successfully on port 3002
- Health check returns: {"status":"healthy","service":"afip-mock-server","version":"1.0.0","database":"connected"}
- Configuration loads correctly with tax categories and invoice types
- Database file created (32KB) with schema initialized
- Graceful shutdown working properly

## Commits
