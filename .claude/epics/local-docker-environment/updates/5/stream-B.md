# Stream B: AFIP Business Logic

## Scope
- CUIT/CUIL validation service with checksum
- CAE generation service
- Invoice service with sequencing
- IVA calculation logic
- Tax category validation

## Files Created
- `docker/mocks/afip/services/cuit.service.js` - CUIT validation with checksum
- `docker/mocks/afip/services/cae.service.js` - CAE generation and expiration
- `docker/mocks/afip/services/invoice.service.js` - Invoice management and sequencing
- `docker/mocks/afip/services/test-services.js` - Integration test suite

## Implementation Summary

### 1. CUIT Validation Service (cuit.service.js)
**Completed Features:**
- ✅ CUIT/CUIL validation with checksum algorithm (weighted sum verification)
- ✅ Format validation (11 digits, XX-XXXXXXXX-X pattern)
- ✅ CUIT formatting and cleaning utilities
- ✅ Type identification (person/company classification)
- ✅ Random CUIT generation for testing
- ✅ Combined validation and formatting operations
- ✅ Structured logging for all operations

**Key Functions:**
- `validateCUIT(cuit)` - Validates CUIT with checksum algorithm
- `validateChecksum(cuit)` - AFIP checksum verification
- `formatCUIT(cuit)` - Formats as XX-XXXXXXXX-X
- `getCUITType(cuit)` - Identifies type (physical/legal person)
- `generateRandomCUIT(typeId)` - Generates valid test CUITs

### 2. CAE Generation Service (cae.service.js)
**Completed Features:**
- ✅ 14-digit CAE generation (YYYYMMDDXXXXXX format)
- ✅ Date-prefixed CAE with random suffix
- ✅ Expiration date calculation (10 days configurable)
- ✅ CAE format validation
- ✅ Date portion validation
- ✅ Expiration checking logic
- ✅ Date extraction from CAE
- ✅ Integration with configuration system

**Key Functions:**
- `generateCAE(date)` - Generates 14-digit CAE
- `getCAEExpiration(date, days)` - Calculates expiration (default 10 days)
- `validateCAEFormat(cae)` - Validates format and date portion
- `isCAEExpired(expirationDate)` - Checks if CAE expired
- `generateCAEWithExpiration()` - Combined generation with expiration
- `extractDateFromCAE(cae)` - Extracts generation date

### 3. Invoice Service (invoice.service.js)
**Completed Features:**
- ✅ Invoice number sequencing per POS (auto-increment)
- ✅ IVA (VAT) calculation based on tax categories
- ✅ Invoice creation with CAE assignment
- ✅ Database integration for persistence
- ✅ CUIT validation for emisor and receptor
- ✅ Amount validation (min/max from config)
- ✅ Tax category and invoice type validation
- ✅ Query operations (by CAE, number, CUIT, date range)
- ✅ Invoice statistics and reporting
- ✅ Last invoice tracking per POS

**Key Functions:**
- `createInvoice(invoiceData)` - Creates invoice with validation, CAE, and IVA
- `getNextInvoiceNumber(pos)` - Auto-increment per POS
- `calculateIVA(baseAmount, taxCategory)` - IVA calculation from config
- `validateInvoiceData(invoiceData)` - Comprehensive validation
- `getInvoiceByCAE(cae)` - Retrieve by CAE
- `getInvoiceByNumber(invoiceNumber, pos)` - Retrieve by number
- `getInvoicesByCUITEmisor(cuit)` - List by CUIT
- `getInvoiceStats(cuit)` - Statistics and totals

### 4. Integration Test (test-services.js)
**Test Coverage:**
- ✅ CUIT validation with valid/invalid inputs
- ✅ CUIT formatting and type identification
- ✅ Random CUIT generation and validation
- ✅ CAE generation and format validation
- ✅ CAE expiration calculation and checking
- ✅ IVA calculation for different tax categories
- ✅ Invoice creation with number sequencing
- ✅ Database persistence and retrieval
- ✅ Query operations (by CAE, number, CUIT)
- ✅ Invoice statistics
- ✅ Validation error handling

**Test Results:**
All tests pass successfully. Services integrate correctly with:
- Database (SQLite with async operations)
- Configuration system (rules.json)
- Logger (Winston structured logging)
- Cross-service dependencies (CUIT + CAE in Invoice)

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture Patterns
- **Singleton Pattern**: All services export singleton instances
- **Dependency Injection**: Invoice service accepts database instance
- **Configuration-Driven**: IVA rates, validation rules from config
- **Structured Logging**: Winston logger for all operations
- **Error Handling**: Try-catch with detailed error logging
- **Validation**: Multi-layer validation (format, checksum, business rules)

### AFIP Standards Compliance
- **CUIT Checksum**: Implements official AFIP weighted algorithm (5,4,3,2,7,6,5,4,3,2)
- **CAE Format**: 14 digits with YYYYMMDD date prefix
- **CAE Expiration**: 10 days default (configurable)
- **IVA Rates**: From configuration (21% for category 1, 0% for categories 4,6,10)
- **Invoice Sequencing**: Per-POS auto-increment as per AFIP requirements

### Database Integration
- **Invoice Table**: Stores all invoice data with CAE
- **POS Config Table**: Tracks last invoice number per POS
- **Indexes**: CAE, invoice number, CUIT, date for fast queries
- **Transactions**: Atomic operations for invoice creation
- **Unique Constraints**: Prevents duplicate invoice numbers per POS
