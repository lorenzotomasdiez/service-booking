# Stream A: Prometheus Configuration

## Scope
Setup Prometheus metrics collection service

## Files
- `docker/monitoring/prometheus/prometheus.yml` (new) ✅
- `docker/monitoring/prometheus/alerts.yml` (new) ✅
- Section in `docker/docker-compose.monitoring.yml` (prometheus service) ✅ (handled by Stream D)

## Progress
- ✅ Stream D completed - docker-compose skeleton ready
- ✅ Created directory structure: `docker/monitoring/prometheus/`
- ✅ Created `prometheus.yml` with global scrape and evaluation intervals (15s)
- ✅ Configured scrape targets:
  - barberpro-backend (backend:3000, /metrics endpoint)
  - postgres-exporter (postgres-exporter:9187)
  - redis-exporter (redis-exporter:9121)
  - cadvisor (cadvisor:8080)
  - prometheus self-monitoring (localhost:9090)
- ✅ Created `alerts.yml` with basic structure for future alert rules
- ✅ Files committed to repository

## Deliverables
Created Prometheus configuration files at:
- `/home/lorenzo/projects/service-booking/docker/monitoring/prometheus/prometheus.yml`
- `/home/lorenzo/projects/service-booking/docker/monitoring/prometheus/alerts.yml`

Configuration follows the specification from task #8, with all required scrape targets properly configured.
