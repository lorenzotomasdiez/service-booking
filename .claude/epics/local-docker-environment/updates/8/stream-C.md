# Stream C: Loki & cAdvisor Configuration

## Scope
Setup log aggregation (Loki) and container monitoring (cAdvisor)

## Files
- `docker/monitoring/loki/loki-config.yml` (new) ✅
- cAdvisor already configured in `docker/docker-compose.monitoring.yml` by Stream D ✅

## Progress
- ✅ Stream D completed - docker-compose skeleton ready
- ✅ Created Loki configuration file
- ✅ Configured file-based storage for local development
- ✅ Set 7-day (168h) log retention policy
- ✅ Configured ingestion and query limits
- ✅ Configured boltdb-shipper for index management
- ✅ Added compactor configuration
- ✅ Committed changes

## Deliverables
Created `/home/lorenzo/projects/service-booking/docker/monitoring/loki/loki-config.yml` with:
- Local development optimized configuration
- File-based storage (no external dependencies)
- 7-day retention period
- Proper ingestion limits (16MB rate, 32MB burst)
- Stream limits (8MB/16MB)
- Ruler configuration for alerting support

Note: cAdvisor doesn't require additional configuration - it's container monitoring is handled directly by the Docker Compose setup in Stream D.
