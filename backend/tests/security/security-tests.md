4. Verify access is denied

Expected: 401 Unauthorized for any token modification
Status: [PASS/FAIL]
```

**Test Case**: JWT Token Expiration

3. Attempt API access with expired token
4. Verify token rejection

Expected: 401 Unauthorized with clear expiration message
Status: [PASS/FAIL]
```

**Test Case**: JWT Secret Key Security
```
Objective: Verify JWT secret key is properly protected
