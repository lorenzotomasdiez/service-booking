## Critical Success Factors & Dependencies

### Timeline & Dependencies:

#### Week 1 Critical Path:
- **Day 1:** Architecture & Design must be completed before development starts
- **Day 2-3:** Backend foundation must be ready before frontend integration
- **Day 4-5:** Payment integration can start in parallel with UI development
- **Day 6-7:** All components integration begins

#### Week 2 Critical Path:
- **Day 8-10:** Feature freeze and integration testing
- **Day 11-12:** Bug fixes and performance optimization
- **Day 13-14:** Production deployment and launch validation

### Daily Coordination Requirements:
- **Daily 30-min standups** at 9:00 AM (all team members)
- **End-of-day sync** between Tech Lead, Frontend, and Backend devs
- **Design review sessions** every other day with Designer and Frontend dev
- **QA review sessions** starting Day 4 (daily with all devs)

### Risk Mitigation:
- **Backup developers:** Each critical role should have a backup person identified
- **Scope flexibility:** Have a "nice-to-have" features list that can be cut if needed
- **Third-party dependencies:** Have backup payment providers ready (Todo Pago)
- **Infrastructure risks:** Use managed services to reduce deployment complexity

**This 2-week timeline is aggressive but achievable with:**
1. **Experienced team members** (no junior developers for this sprint)
2. **Clear daily coordination** and communication protocols
3. **Parallel work streams** with minimal blocking dependencies
4. **Scope discipline** - absolutely no feature creep during the 2 weeks
5. **Pre-work preparation** - accounts, access, and environments ready on Day 1

The key to success is having the **Tech Lead orchestrate** the parallel work streams and maintaining **ruthless focus** on the core MVP features only.
