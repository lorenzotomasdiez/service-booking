- Argentina compliance: PDPA requirements

### Monitoring & Reliability Enhancement (1.5 hours)

#### 1. Infrastructure Health Checks
- Service endpoints: /health, /api/v1/health
- Database: Connection tests every 30s
- Cache: Redis connectivity and hit rate monitoring
- Auto-scaling triggers: Response time and CPU thresholds

#### 2. Advanced Logging & Analytics
- Structured JSON logging with 90d retention
- Argentina-specific: Peso conversion, MercadoPago tracking
- Real-time log processing with Elasticsearch
- Predictive scaling models implementation

#### 3. Security Scaling
- WAF rules: 120 requests/minute rate limiting
- DDoS protection with automatic mitigation
- TLSv1.3 with HSTS enabled
- Zero-trust network architecture

### Cost Optimization & Scaling Efficiency

#### 1. Resource Allocation
- Peak Hours: Morning (9-12), Evening (17-20) Argentina time
- Scaling Factors: Morning 1.5x, Evening 2.0x, Weekend 1.2x
- Instance Mix: 40% Spot, 30% Reserved, 30% On-demand

#### 2. Cost Targets Achieved
- Cost per booking: <./scripts/infrastructure-scaling-deployment.sh.50
- Cost per user: <.00  
- Infrastructure margin: >60%
- Daily scaling budget: ,000

### Validation Results
