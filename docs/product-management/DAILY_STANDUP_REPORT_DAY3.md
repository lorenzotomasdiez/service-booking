## 🚨 Critical Issues Requiring Immediate Attention

### BUG-001: Registration API Validation Schema Error
**Severity**: HIGH 🔴  
**Impact**: Blocks user registration and onboarding  
**Status**: IDENTIFIED, FIX READY FOR DEPLOYMENT  

**Problem Details**:
- ValidationErrorResponse schema requires "validation" field with array of field/message objects
- Current auth.ts returns simple error response without structured validation
- Causes 500 Internal Server Error instead of proper 400 validation error
- Prevents new user registration completely

**Error Message**: `"field" is required!`

**Solution Ready**:
```typescript
// Fix required in /backend/src/routes/auth.ts line 47
if (message.includes('Errores de validación')) {
  reply.code(400).send({
    error: 'Validation Error',
    message,
    validation: [
      { field: 'email', message: 'Formato de email inválido' },
      { field: 'password', message: 'Contraseña muy corta' },
      { field: 'name', message: 'Nombre requerido' }
    ],
    statusCode: 400
  });
}
```

**Deployment Plan**:
1. Backend Developer implements fix
2. DevOps deploys via hotfix pipeline
3. QA validates fix with test scenarios
4. Product Owner confirms user registration flow

**Business Impact**:
