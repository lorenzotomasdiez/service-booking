## BLOCKING DEPENDENCY RESOLUTION

### **High-Risk Dependencies (Must Monitor)**

#### **Critical Path Blockers:**
1. **Authentication System (Day 1-2)**
   - **Risk:** All features depend on user authentication
   - **Mitigation:** Complete auth endpoints before any other backend work
   - **Success Criteria:** JWT login working, user registration complete

2. **MercadoPago Integration (Day 10-11)**
   - **Risk:** Payment failures block booking confirmations
   - **Mitigation:** Thorough testing with sandbox, backup payment processor ready
   - **Success Criteria:** End-to-end payment flow tested successfully

3. **Real-time Availability (Day 6)**
   - **Risk:** Double bookings if availability calculation fails
   - **Mitigation:** Pessimistic locking, conflict detection algorithms
   - **Success Criteria:** Zero double-booking incidents in testing

#### **Cross-Team Dependencies:**
```
