# Specification Quality Checklist: Fully Dockerized Development Environment with Hot Reload

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-25
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

**Validation Results**: âœ… All checklist items pass

**Specification Quality**: The specification is complete and ready for planning phase.

**Key Strengths**:
- Clear prioritization of user stories (P1, P2, P3) with independent testability
- Comprehensive edge cases covering Docker-specific failure scenarios
- 25 functional requirements with clear, testable outcomes
- 12 measurable success criteria with specific time/performance targets
- Well-defined assumptions and out-of-scope items
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - all requirements are concrete

**Ready for**: `/speckit.plan` - Proceed to implementation planning phase
