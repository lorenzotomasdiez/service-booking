# Specification Quality Checklist: Registration Completion with Email and Google OAuth

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-25
**Feature**: [../spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Summary

**Status**: âœ… PASSED - Specification is complete and ready for planning

**Clarifications Resolved**:
1. User type selection: Separate registration URLs (/register/client, /register/provider) while maintaining existing dual-role selection
2. Frontend/backend scope: Research completed - email/password flow exists, OAuth and email verification need to be built

**Key Findings from Codebase Research**:
- Email/password registration fully functional (frontend + backend)
- Google OAuth UI exists but backend not implemented
- Email verification field exists in database but no verification flow
- Argentina-specific validations already working (DNI, CUIT, phone)

## Notes

All validation items passed. Feature is ready for `/speckit.plan` to generate implementation plan.
